# Stack

## Introduction

A stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). Mainly the following three basic operations are performed in the stack:

1.  Push: Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
2.  Pop: Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
3.  Peek or Top: Returns top element of stack.

## Uses of Stack

1.  In compilers, stack is used to store the variables and parameters of a function while a function call is in progress.
2.  In recursion, the function call is made by pushing the parameters and return address of the previous function call in the stack and removed when the function returns.

## Summary

1.  Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
2.  The order may be LIFO or FILO.
3.  The basic operations in stack are PUSH, POP and PEEK.
4.  Stack is used in many real-life scenarios. It can be used to reverse a word or to check if a string is palindrome or to convert decimal number to binary number.
